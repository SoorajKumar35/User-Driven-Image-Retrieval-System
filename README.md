# User-Driven-Image-Retrieval-System
1. Utilized Metric Learning (Mahalanobis distance) to aid users in finding relevant images out of 1400
images and that are similar in over 47 unique attributes to the image of their choice.
2. Implemented round system to allow user feedback on images returned, thus increasing accuracy in
subsequent rounds of image retrieval
3. Experimentation on images returned per round revealed that precision (number of relevant images
returned by total number of images returned) always either increased or plateaued.
